Execution of Tests in TestNG Factory is not ordered. 
Itâ€™s intuitive to think that the execution might retain the 
order in which tests have been added, but it does not.

However, Method Interceptors provides a way to snoop in and 
see the list of TestNG Methods and potentially edit the order 
(may be based on the Test that have been added)
